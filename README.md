A [DangerJS](https://danger.systems/js/) plugin to help with PR validation.

## Installation

```sh
npm install danger-plugin-pr-utilities --save-dev

# or

yarn add danger-plugin-pr-utilities --dev
```

The library is currently still in its early stages and doesn't contain much functionality. If you have any ideas for new features, please open an issue or a PR!

(For now, it's actually just containing the default code when setting up a project for DangerJS.)
